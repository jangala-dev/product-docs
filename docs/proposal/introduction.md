# Introduction

> "Coming together is a beginning, staying together is progress, and working together is success." â€“ Henry Ford

Welcome to our proposed new process to create, manage, and share documentation for our projects, including Big Box, Get Box and everything else in the future! This document introduces the new documentation system, which builds on the power of Markdown and GitHub.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to introduce a structured and efficient approach to handling our project documentation. Our aim is to move away from our current system, which, while familiar, presents several challenges (that we've encountered!) that hinder our productivity and the quality of our work. By adopting Markdown and GitHub, we're adopting a workflow that enhances collaboration, flexibility and the integrity of our documentation over time.

## Rationale

Our existing system, based  on Google Docs, has served us well to a point. However, as we scale and our products become more complex, the limitations of this system have and will become increasingly apparent: such as issues with accessibility, version control, document synchronisation, and the rigidity of the printable page format.

## Outcomes

By moving to Markdown for our core written content creation and GitHub for hosting and collaboration, we anticipate a multitude of benefits:

- **Flexibility and Accessibility**: The ability to easily convert our documentation into various formats (PDF, HTML, etc.), making it accessible across different platforms and to different audiences.

- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Structured collaboration across our team, with tools designed for reviewing, discussing, and merging changes.

- **Improved Version Control**: A robust system to track changes, manage versions, and revert to previous states if necessary, ensuring that our documentation remains current and accurate.

- **Alignment with Open-Source Principles**: We're an organisation committed to open-source and these are some of the most celebrated open source test-editing tools!

This transition can enhance our capability to deliver impactful and reliable documentation that supports our mission to connect and empower marginalised communities worldwide.

Let's go!
