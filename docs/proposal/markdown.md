# Markdown in action

Markdown allows us to write using an easy-to-learn syntax that can be quickly converted into various formats, making it ideal for our diverse documentation needs. Let's dive right in!

### A simple example in Markdown

```markdown
# A Top Level Heading

With Markdown you can just start writing text. It's easy to emphasise single _words_ or _whole phrases of text_. Making words **bold** is simply a **different** set of annotations to _italic_. You can even commit major crimes against the spirits of style by **combining bold and _italic_**. Maybe we can just ~~scratch this.~~

You start a new paragraph just by leaving an empty line between blocks of text. 

## Lists and bits

Unordered lists can use - or * with levels indicated by indentation:

- Vegetables
- Fruits
   - Apples
   - Oranges

Ordered lists just use the format '1.' and indentation just like above.

1. Cherry Coke
2. Rubicon
   1. Passion Fruit
   2. Mango

## Other elements

It's easy to create hyperlinks to external [websites](https://www.janga.la). Image links are also easy to create:

You can create tables using the really easy format below:

| Header 1    | Header 2    |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Row 1 Col 1 | Row 1 Col 2 |
| Row 2 Col 1 | Row 2 Col 2 |

A block quote:

> “I have just three things to teach: simplicity, patience, compassion. These three are your greatest treasures.” - Lao Tzu
```

When this Markdown is rendered it becomes:
