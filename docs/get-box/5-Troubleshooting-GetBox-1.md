## 1. Why can't Iaccess the internet?
* Check your SIM card is inserted correctly
(see image 1, below)
* Remove your SIM card and insert it again
* Check the antennas are screwed in
correctly. Ensure you have screwed them 1 into the correct colour-coordinated ports
* Your SIM card may have run out of data. You can check this by inserting the SIM ni your phone and dialling 4444
* If you still can't access the internet, please contact the organisation responsible for your Get Box

## 2. Why is my internet slow?
* You may have poor signal, the LED lights will indicate how strong your signal is.
* Try moving Get Box to a location with a clear view of the sky. For example, near a window.
* Try moving Get Box to somewhere with less obstructions. For example, avoid putting it on a bookcase or under a table.
