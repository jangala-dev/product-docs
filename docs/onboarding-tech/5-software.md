# Software Ecosystem
At Jangla, we pride ourselves on a diverse and specialized software ecosystem that powers everything from device firmware to cloud services. Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to tech, here's a straightforward breakdown of what makes our systems work and how they interact to deliver exceptional performance and reliability.

## Cloud Services
Our cloud operations are powered by Go, known for its stellar performance in managing multiple tasks simultaneously. These services play a crucial role in updating, controlling, and monitoring our devices, ensuring everything runs smoothly with continuous feedback from device telemetry.

## Device Firmware
Our devices utilize OpenWRT, a Linux distribution that's particularly suited for our WiFi routers. This choice supports a stable and secure operation, allowing us to leverage OpenWRT's flexibility and robust community support.

## Device Software
On the device side, we use Lua for its small footprint and ability to interact closely with the operating system. This ensures our devices are not only effective but also efficient in their daily operations.

## User Interfaces
For both device and cloud interfaces, we use a combination of JavaScript, TypeScript, and Vue.js. These technologies help us create responsive, intuitive user interfaces that enhance the overall user experience, making our products not only powerful but also a pleasure to use.

## DevOps
Kubernetes stands at the core of our DevOps practices, helping us keep our systems scalable and robust. It enables us to manage our hosting environment effectively, ensuring that we can scale as needed without sacrificing performance.

As you begin your journey with Jangla, you'll find that our tech stack isn't just about the tools we use; it's about creating a seamless, integrated experience that meets our high standards of quality and innovation. Whether you're working directly with our technology or supporting it from a broader role, understanding this ecosystem will help you see the big picture of how we achieve our goals at Jangla.
