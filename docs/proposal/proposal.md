# A Proposed Future System

> "It's like I always say, 'Can't win, don't try.'" - Homer J. Simpson

Given our current limitations, Jangala needs a better solution to support our evolving requirements. We propose a system that uses Markdown for document creation and GitHub for document hosting, version control, and collaboration. This system is designed to address the challenges identified above, improving our documentation's accessibility, versatility, and overall quality.

## Overview

Markdown is a lightweight markup language, a way of of quickly writing structured text that's not locked to a specific format like Word or Google Docs. GitHub is a platform that provudes powerful version control and collaboration features. The combination of the two offers a workflow for creating, managing, and sharing documentation that is not only more efficient but also scalable as our projects grow in complexity and scope.

## Non-technical Description

If you're not familiar with Markdown and GitHub, think of this proposed system as a more flexible and collaborative version of Google Docs. Instead of being constrained to a single document format or struggling with version histories, imagine a workspace where:

- **Documents are easily editable by anyone, anywhere**, without worrying about having the latest version.
- **Changes are tracked transparently**, with the ability to see who made what changes and why, leading to easier reviews and ensuring documentation accuracy.
- **Multiple versions of a document can be managed effortlessly**, allowing us to maintain various iterations of our documentation for different product versions or deployment scenarios.
- **Our documents are adaptable**, meaning we can quickly transform them into whatever format best suits the task at hand, from online manuals to embedded help systems within our products.

This transition to Markdown and GitHub would represent a significant shift in how we create, share, and maintain our project documentation. However, this doesn't need to be frightening!
