## Networking: How you got to the Knowledge Base
### Summary
In this Article, we dive into the world of networking â€“ the essential framework enabling your access to this knowledge base. We'll trace the journey from the initial click to the moment this page loads, spotlighting the  technologies and protocols that allowed for this process.

### The Electromagnetic Spectrum: Our Starting Point
Our journey starts with the electromagnetic spectrum, a vast expanse of frequencies ranging from radio waves to gamma and X-rays. In the world of networking, we concentrate on radio waves, the conduits for Wi-Fi (2.4-6 GHz) and cellular signals (2G to 5G). These waves create the unseen web of our digital connectivity.

### Wi-Fi: The Unseen Link
Let's assume your current device connection is via Wi-Fi which is being broadcasted by Big Box. This technology employs radio waves to form a bridge between your devices and the internet, operating across 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz frequencies. Each band offers a unique balance of coverage and speed, tailored to different environmental needs.

### Jangala's Innovations: Big Box and Get Box
Our Big Box broadcasts on both 2.4 and 5GHz frequencies, while the Get Box focuses solely on the 2.4GHz band. To ensure comprehensive network coverage, we also deploy access points, enhancing the reach and reliability of the wifi network.

### Routers: The Navigators of Your Network
Routers are the pivotal elements that direct internet traffic within your network. Our Big Box serves as a dynamic router, skillfully managing data flow, even under limited internet speed conditions, ensuring a consistent and efficient online experience.

### Backhaul: The Digital Highway
Backhaul forms the crucial link connecting local networks to the broader internet. Our products can use a range of backhauls including copper wires, fibre optics, and cellular links. This adaptability ensures a resilient connection depending on what is available. 

### IP Addresses: Digital Identifier
When you connect to the internet, your router reserves an IP address from the internet service provider. Subsequently, your device is assigned a local IP address by the router. This unique identifier is vital for accurately directing internet traffic. Our routers adeptly manage these addresses within local networks, ensuring orderly and precise data transmission.

### The Final Step: Accessing the Knowledge Base
The final leg of this journey brings you to this knowledge base. Your request is routed through the local network set up by the Big Box router, reaching out to the server of the internet provider, and then to the storage centre hosting the Jangala Knowledge Base. The server then retraces this path to deliver the data back to you, enabling this page to load on your screen. Despite its complexity, this process is streamlined by the seamless interaction of various network components.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, from the invisible waves of the electromagnetic spectrum to the sophisticated routing capabilities of Big Box, every step in this journey underscores the intricate yet harmonious nature of networking. It's a testament to how advanced technology and thoughtful design come together to keep us connected in the digital world.
